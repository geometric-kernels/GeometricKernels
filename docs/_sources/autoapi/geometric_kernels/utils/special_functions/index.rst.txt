.. py:function:: generalized_kravchuk_normalized(d, j, m, q, kravchuk_normalized_j_minus_1 = None, kravchuk_normalized_j_minus_2 = None)

   This function returns $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j}(m)$ where $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j}(m)$ is the
   normalized generalized Kravchuk polynomial defined below.

   Define the generalized Kravchuk polynomial of degree $d > 0$ and order $0 \leq j \leq d$
   as the function $G_{d, q, j}(m)$ of the independent variable $0 \leq m \leq d$ given by

   .. math:: G_{d, q, j}(m) = \sum_{\substack{T \subseteq \{0, .., d-1\} \\ |T| = j}}
             \sum_{\alpha \in \{1,..,q-1\}^T} \psi_{T,\alpha}(x) \overline{\psi_{T,\alpha}(y)}.

   Here $\psi_{T,\alpha}$ are the Vilenkin functions on the q-ary Hamming graph $H(d,q)$ and
   $x, y \in \{0, 1, ..., q-1\}^d$ are arbitrary categorical vectors at Hamming distance $m$
   (the right-hand side does not depend on the choice of particular vectors of the kind).

   The normalized polynomial is $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j}(m) = G_{d, q, j}(m) / G_{d, q, j}(0)$.

   .. note::
       We are using the three term recurrence relation to compute the Kravchuk
       polynomials. Cf. Equation (60) of Chapter 5 in MacWilliams and Sloane "The
       Theory of Error-Correcting Codes", 1977. The parameter $\gamma$ from
       :cite:t:`macwilliams1977` is set to $\gamma = q - 1$.

   .. note::
       We use the fact that $G_{d, q, j}(0) = \binom{d}{j}(q-1)^j$.

   .. note::
       For $q = 2$, this reduces to the classical Kravchuk polynomials.

   :param d:
       The degree of Kravchuk polynomial, an integer $d > 0$.
       Maps to $n$ in :cite:t:`macwilliams1977`.

   :param j:
       The order of Kravchuk polynomial, an integer $0 \leq j \leq d$.
       Maps to $k$ in :cite:t:`macwilliams1977`.

   :param m:
       The independent variable (Hamming distance), an integer or array with
       $0 \leq m \leq d$. Maps to $x$ in :cite:t:`macwilliams1977`.

   :param q:
       The alphabet size of the q-ary Hamming graph, an integer $q \geq 2$.

   :param kravchuk_normalized_j_minus_1:
       The optional precomputed value of $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j-1}(m)$, helps
       to avoid exponential complexity growth due to the recursion.

   :param kravchuk_normalized_j_minus_2:
       The optional precomputed value of $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j-2}(m)$, helps
       to avoid exponential complexity growth due to the recursion.

   :return:
       $\widetilde{G}_{d, q, j}(m) = G_{d, q, j}(m) / G_{d, q, j}(0)$ where
       $G_{d, q, j}(m)$ is the generalized Kravchuk polynomial.


.. py:function:: walsh_function(d, combination, x)

   This function returns the value of the Walsh function

   .. math:: w_T(x_0, .., x_{d-1}) = (-1)^{\sum_{j \in T} x_j}

   where $d$ is `d`, $T$ is `combination`, and $x = (x_0, .., x_{d-1})$ is `x`.

   :param d:
       The degree of the Walsh function and the dimension of its inputs.
       An integer d > 0.
   :param combination:
       A subset of the set $\{0, .., d-1\}$ determining the particular Walsh
       function. A list of integers.
   :param x:
       A batch of binary vectors $x = (x_0, .., x_{d-1})$ of shape [N, d].

   :return:
       The value of the Walsh function $w_T(x)$ evaluated for every $x$ in the
       batch. An array of shape [N].
