.. py:class:: BaseGeometricKernel(space)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Abstract base class for geometric kernels.

   :param space:
       The space on which the kernel is defined.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2 = None, **kwargs)
      :abstractmethod:


      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.

      :param params:
          A dict of kernel parameters, typically containing two keys:
          `"lengthscale"` for length scale and `"nu"` for smoothness.

          The types of values in the params dict determine the output type
          and the backend used for the internal computations, see the
          warning below for more details.

          .. note::
              The values `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]` are
              typically (1,)-shaped arrays of the suitable backend. This
              serves to point at the backend to be used for internal
              computations.

              In some cases, for example, when the kernel is
              :class:`~.kernels.ProductGeometricKernel`, the values of
              `params` may be (s,)-shaped arrays instead, where `s` is the
              number of factors.

          .. note::
              Finite values of `params["nu"]` typically correspond to the
              generalized (geometric) Matérn kernels.

              Infinite `params["nu"]` typically corresponds to the heat
              kernel (a.k.a. diffusion kernel, generalized squared
              exponential kernel, generalized Gaussian kernel,
              generalized RBF kernel). Although it is often considered to be
              a separate entity, we treat the heat kernel as a member of
              the Matérn family, with smoothness parameter equal to infinity.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.
      :param X2:
          A batch of M inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

          `X2=None` sets `X2=X1`.

          Defaults to None.

      :return:
          The N x M cross-covariance matrix.

      .. warning::
         The types of values in the `params` dict determine the backend
         used for internal computations and the output type.

         Even if, say, `geometric_kernels.jax` is imported but the values in
         the `params` dict are NumPy arrays, the output type will be a NumPy
         array, and NumPy will be used for internal computations. To get a
         JAX array as an output and use JAX for internal computations, all
         the values in the `params` dict must be JAX arrays.



   .. py:method:: K_diag(params, X, **kwargs)
      :abstractmethod:


      Returns the diagonal of the covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`,
      typically in a more efficient way than actually computing the full
      covariance matrix with `self.K(params, X, X)` and then extracting its
      diagonal.

      :param params:
          Same as for :meth:`~.K`.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

      :return:
          The N-dimensional vector representing the diagonal of the
          covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`.



   .. py:method:: init_params()
      :abstractmethod:


      Initializes the dict of the trainable parameters of the kernel.

      It typically contains only two keys: `"nu"` and `"lengthscale"`.

      This dict can be modified and is passed around into such methods as
      :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, as the `params` argument.

      .. note::
          The values in the returned dict are always of the NumPy array type.
          Thus, if you want to use some other backend for internal
          computations when calling :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, you
          need to replace the values with the analogs typed as arrays of
          the desired backend.



   .. py:property:: space
      :type: beartype.typing.Union[geometric_kernels.spaces.Space, beartype.typing.List[geometric_kernels.spaces.Space]]


      The space on which the kernel is defined.



.. py:class:: MaternFeatureMapKernel(space, feature_map, key, normalize = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.kernels.base.BaseGeometricKernel`


   This class computes a (Matérn) kernel based on a feature map.

   .. math :: k_{\nu, \kappa}(x, y) = \langle \phi_{\nu, \kappa}(x), \phi_{\nu, \kappa}(y) \rangle_{\mathbb{R}^n}

   where $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ is the standard inner
   product in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\phi_{\nu, \kappa}: X \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is
   an arbitrary function called *feature map*. We assume that it depends
   on the smoothness and length scale parameters $\nu$ and $\kappa$,
   respectively, which makes this kernel specifically Matérn.

   .. note::
       A brief introduction into feature maps and related kernels can be
       found on :doc:`this page </theory/feature_maps>`.

       Note that the finite-dimensional feature maps this kernel is meant to
       be used with are, in most cases, some approximations of the
       intractable infinite-dimensional feature maps.

   :param space:
       The space on which the kernel is defined.
   :param feature_map:
       A :class:`~.feature_maps.FeatureMap` object that represents an
       arbitrary function $\phi_{\nu, \kappa}: X \to \mathbb{R}^n$, where
       $X$ is the `space`, $n$ can be an arbitrary finite integer, and
       $\nu, \kappa$ are the smoothness and length scale parameters.
   :param key:
       Random state, either `np.random.RandomState`,
       `tf.random.Generator`, `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (which
       represents a random state).

       Many feature maps used in the library are randomized, thus requiring a
       `key` to work. The :class:`MaternFeatureMapKernel` uses this `key` to
       make them (and thus the kernel) deterministic, applying the utility
       function :func:`~.make_deterministic` to the pair `feature_map, key`.

       .. note::
          Even if the `feature_map` is deterministic, you need to provide a
          valid key, although it will essentially be ignored. In the future,
          we should probably make the `key` parameter optional.

   :param normalize:
       This parameter is directly passed on to the `feature_map` as a keyword
       argument "normalize". If normalize=True, then either $k(x, x) = 1$ for
       all $x \in X$, or $\int_X k(x, x) d x = 1$, depending on the type of
       the feature map and on the space $X$.

       .. note::
           For many kernel methods, $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ and $a k(\cdot, \cdot)$
           are indistinguishable, whatever the positive constant $a$ is. For
           these, it makes sense to use normalize=False to save up some
           computational overhead. For others, like for the Gaussian process
           regression, the normalization of the kernel might be important. In
           these cases, you will typically want to set normalize=True.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2 = None, **kwargs)

      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.

      :param params:
          A dict of kernel parameters, typically containing two keys:
          `"lengthscale"` for length scale and `"nu"` for smoothness.

          The types of values in the params dict determine the output type
          and the backend used for the internal computations, see the
          warning below for more details.

          .. note::
              The values `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]` are
              typically (1,)-shaped arrays of the suitable backend. This
              serves to point at the backend to be used for internal
              computations.

              In some cases, for example, when the kernel is
              :class:`~.kernels.ProductGeometricKernel`, the values of
              `params` may be (s,)-shaped arrays instead, where `s` is the
              number of factors.

          .. note::
              Finite values of `params["nu"]` typically correspond to the
              generalized (geometric) Matérn kernels.

              Infinite `params["nu"]` typically corresponds to the heat
              kernel (a.k.a. diffusion kernel, generalized squared
              exponential kernel, generalized Gaussian kernel,
              generalized RBF kernel). Although it is often considered to be
              a separate entity, we treat the heat kernel as a member of
              the Matérn family, with smoothness parameter equal to infinity.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.
      :param X2:
          A batch of M inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

          `X2=None` sets `X2=X1`.

          Defaults to None.

      :return:
          The N x M cross-covariance matrix.

      .. warning::
         The types of values in the `params` dict determine the backend
         used for internal computations and the output type.

         Even if, say, `geometric_kernels.jax` is imported but the values in

         the values in the `params` dict must be JAX arrays.



   .. py:method:: K_diag(params, X, **kwargs)

      Returns the diagonal of the covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`,
      typically in a more efficient way than actually computing the full
      covariance matrix with `self.K(params, X, X)` and then extracting its
      diagonal.

      :param params:
          Same as for :meth:`~.K`.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

      :return:
          The N-dimensional vector representing the diagonal of the
          covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`.



   .. py:method:: init_params()

      Initializes the dict of the trainable parameters of the kernel.

      Returns `dict(nu=np.array([np.inf]), lengthscale=np.array([1.0]))`.

      This dict can be modified and is passed around into such methods as
      :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, as the `params` argument.

      .. note::
          The values in the returned dict are always of the NumPy array type.
          Thus, if you want to use some other backend for internal
          computations when calling :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, you
          need to replace the values with the analogs typed as arrays of
          the desired backend.



.. py:class:: MaternGeometricKernel

   This class represents a Matérn geometric kernel that "just works". Unless
   you really know what you are doing, you should always use this kernel class.

   Upon creation, unpacks into a specific geometric kernel based on the
   provided space, and, optionally, the associated (approximate) feature map.


   .. py:method:: __new__(space, num = None, normalize = True, return_feature_map = False, **kwargs)

      Construct a kernel and (if `return_feature_map` is `True`) a
      feature map on `space`.

      .. note::
         See :doc:`this page </theory/feature_maps>` for a brief
         introduction into feature maps.

      :param space:
          Space to construct the kernel on.

      :param num:
          If provided, controls the "order of approximation" of the kernel.
          For the discrete spectrum spaces, this means the number of "levels"
          that go into the truncated series that defines the kernel (for
          example, these are unique eigenvalues for the
          :class:`~.spaces.Hypersphere` or eigenvalues with repetitions for
          the :class:`~.spaces.Graph` or for the :class:`~.spaces.Mesh`).
          For the non-compact symmetric spaces
          (:class:`~.spaces.NoncompactSymmetricSpace`), this is the number
          of random phases used to construct the kernel.

          If num=None, we use a (hopefully) reasonable default, which is
          space-dependent.

      :param normalize:
          Normalize the kernel (and the feature map). If normalize=True,
          then either $k(x, x) = 1$ for all $x \in X$, where $X$ is the
          `space`, or $\int_X k(x, x) d x = 1$, depending on the space.

          Defaults to True.

          .. note::
              For many kernel methods, $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ and
              $a k(\cdot, \cdot)$ are indistinguishable, whatever the
              positive constant $a$ is. For these, it makes sense to use
              normalize=False to save up some computational overhead. For
              others, like for the Gaussian process regression, the
              normalization of the kernel might be important. In
              these cases, you will typically want to set normalize=True.

      :param return_feature_map:
          If `True`, return a feature map (needed e.g. for efficient sampling
          from Gaussian processes) along with the kernel.

          Default is False.

      :param ``**kwargs``:
          Any additional keyword arguments to be passed to the kernel
          (like `key`).

      .. note::
         For non-compact symmetric spaces, like :class:`~.spaces.Hyperbolic`
         or :class:`~.spaces.SymmetricPositiveDefiniteMatrices`, the `key`
         **must** be provided in ``**kwargs``.



.. py:class:: MaternHodgeCompositionalKernel(space, num_levels, normalize = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.kernels.base.BaseGeometricKernel`


   This class is similar to :class:`~.kernels.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel`, but
   provides a more expressive family of kernels on the spaces where Hodge
   decomposition is available.

   The resulting kernel is a sum of three kernels,

   .. math:: k(x, x') = a k_{\text{harmonic}}(x, x') + b k_{\text{gradient}}(x, x') + c k_{\text{curl}}(x, x'),

   where $a, b, c$ are weights $a, b, c \geq 0$ and $a + b + c = 1$, and
   $k_{\text{harmonic}}$, $k_{\text{gradient}}$, $k_{\text{curl}}$ are the
   instances of :class:`~.kernels.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel` that only use the
   eigenpairs of the Laplacian corresponding to a single part of the Hodge
   decomposition.

   The parameters of this kernel are represented by a dict with three keys:
   `"harmonic"`, `"gradient"`, `"curl"`, each corresponding to a dict with
   keys `"logit"`, `"nu"`, `"lengthscale"`, where `"nu"` and `"lengthscale"`
   are the parameters of the respective :class:`~.kernels.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel`,
   while the `"logit"` parameters determine the weights $a, b, c$ in the
   formula above: $a, b, c$ are the `"logit"` parameters normalized to
   satisfy $a + b + c = 1$.

   Same as for :class:`~.kernels.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel`, these kernels can sometimes
   be computed more efficiently using addition theorems.

   .. note::
       A brief introduction into the theory behind
       :class:`~.kernels.MaternHodgeCompositionalKernel` can be found in
       :doc:`this </theory/graphs>` documentation page.

   :param space:
       The space to define the kernel upon, a subclass of :class:`~.spaces.HodgeDiscreteSpectrumSpace`.

   :param num_levels:
       Number of levels to include in the summation.

   :param normalize:
       Whether to normalize kernel to have unit average variance.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2 = None, **kwargs)

      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.



   .. py:method:: K_diag(params, X, **kwargs)

      Returns the diagonal of the covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`,
      typically in a more efficient way than actually computing the full
      covariance matrix with `self.K(params, X, X)` and then extracting its
      diagonal.



   .. py:method:: init_params()

      Initialize the three sets of parameters for the three kernels.



   .. py:property:: space
      :type: geometric_kernels.spaces.HodgeDiscreteSpectrumSpace


      The space on which the kernel is defined.



.. py:class:: MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel(space, num_levels, normalize = True, eigenvalues_laplacian = None, eigenfunctions = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.kernels.base.BaseGeometricKernel`


   This class approximates Matérn kernel by its truncated Mercer decomposition,
   in terms of the eigenfunctions & eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the space.

   .. math:: k(x, x') = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} S(\sqrt\lambda_l) \sum_{s=1}^{d_l} f_{ls}(x) f_{ls}(x'),

   where $\lambda_l$ and $f_{ls}(\cdot)$ are the eigenvalues and
   eigenfunctions of the Laplacian such that
   $\Delta f_{ls} = \lambda_l f_{ls}$, and $S(\cdot)$ is the spectrum
   of the Matérn kernel. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions belong to the
   :class:`~.spaces.DiscreteSpectrumSpace` instance.

   We denote

   .. math:: G_l(\cdot, \cdot') = \sum_{s=1}^{d_l} f_{ls}(\cdot) f_{ls}(\cdot')

   and term the sets $[f_{ls}]_{s=1}^{d_l}$  *"levels"*.

   For many spaces, like the sphere, we can employ addition
   theorems to efficiently compute $G_l(\cdot, \cdot')$ without calculating
   the individual $f_{ls}(\cdot)$. Note that $\lambda_l$ are not required to
   be unique: it is possible that for some $l,l'$, $\lambda_l = \lambda_{l'}$.
   In other words, the "levels" do not necessarily correspond to full
   eigenspaces. A level may even correspond to a single eigenfunction.

   .. note::
       A brief introduction into the theory behind
       :class:`MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel` can be found in
       :doc:`this </theory/compact>` & :doc:`this </theory/addition_theorem>`
       documentation pages.

   :param space:
       The space to define the kernel upon.
   :param num_levels:
       Number of levels to include in the summation.
   :param normalize:
       Whether to normalize kernel to have unit average variance.
   :param eigenvalues_laplacian:
       Allowing to pass the eigenvalues of the Laplacian directly, instead of
       computing them from the space. If provided, `eigenfunctions` must also
       be provided. Used for :class:`~.spaces.HodgeDiscreteSpectrumSpace`.
   :param eigenfunctions:
       Allowing to pass the eigenfunctions directly, instead of computing them
       from the space. If provided, `eigenvalues_laplacian` must also be provided.
       Used for :class:`~.spaces.HodgeDiscreteSpectrumSpace`.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2 = None, **kwargs)

      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.

      :param params:
          A dict of kernel parameters, typically containing two keys:
          `"lengthscale"` for length scale and `"nu"` for smoothness.

          The types of values in the params dict determine the output type
          and the backend used for the internal computations, see the
          warning below for more details.

          .. note::
              The values `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]` are
              typically (1,)-shaped arrays of the suitable backend. This
              serves to point at the backend to be used for internal
              computations.

              In some cases, for example, when the kernel is
              :class:`~.kernels.ProductGeometricKernel`, the values of
              `params` may be (s,)-shaped arrays instead, where `s` is the
              number of factors.

          .. note::
              Finite values of `params["nu"]` typically correspond to the
              generalized (geometric) Matérn kernels.

              Infinite `params["nu"]` typically corresponds to the heat
              kernel (a.k.a. diffusion kernel, generalized squared
              exponential kernel, generalized Gaussian kernel,
              generalized RBF kernel). Although it is often considered to be
              a separate entity, we treat the heat kernel as a member of
              the Matérn family, with smoothness parameter equal to infinity.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.
      :param X2:
          A batch of M inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

          `X2=None` sets `X2=X1`.

          Defaults to None.

      :return:
          The N x M cross-covariance matrix.

      .. warning::
         The types of values in the `params` dict determine the backend
         used for internal computations and the output type.

         Even if, say, `geometric_kernels.jax` is imported but the values in
         the `params` dict are NumPy arrays, the output type will be a NumPy
         array, and NumPy will be used for internal computations. To get a
         JAX array as an output and use JAX for internal computations, all
         the values in the `params` dict must be JAX arrays.



   .. py:method:: K_diag(params, X, **kwargs)

      Returns the diagonal of the covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`,
      typically in a more efficient way than actually computing the full
      covariance matrix with `self.K(params, X, X)` and then extracting its
      diagonal.

      :param params:
          Same as for :meth:`~.K`.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

      :return:
          The N-dimensional vector representing the diagonal of the
          covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`.



   .. py:method:: eigenvalues(params)

      Eigenvalues of the kernel.

      :param params:
          Parameters of the kernel. Must contain keys `"lengthscale"` and
          `"nu"`. The shapes of `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]`
          are `(1,)`.

      :return:
          An [L, 1]-shaped array.



   .. py:method:: init_params()

      Initializes the dict of the trainable parameters of the kernel.

      Returns `dict(nu=np.array([np.inf]), lengthscale=np.array([1.0]))`.

      This dict can be modified and is passed around into such methods as
      :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, as the `params` argument.

      .. note::
          The values in the returned dict are always of the NumPy array type.
          Thus, if you want to use some other backend for internal
          computations when calling :meth:`~.K` or :meth:`~.K_diag`, you
          need to replace the values with the analogs typed as arrays of
          the desired backend.



   .. py:method:: spectrum(s, nu, lengthscale, dimension)
      :staticmethod:


      Static method computing the spectrum of the Matérn kernel with
      hyperparameters `nu` and `lengthscale` on the space with eigenvalues `s`
      and dimension `dimension`.

      :param s:
          The eigenvalues of the space.
      :param nu:
          The smoothness parameter of the kernel.
      :param lengthscale:
          The length scale parameter of the kernel.
      :param dimension:
          The dimension of the space.

      :return:
          The spectrum of the Matérn kernel.



   .. py:property:: eigenfunctions
      :type: geometric_kernels.spaces.eigenfunctions.Eigenfunctions


      Eigenfunctions of the kernel.



   .. py:property:: eigenvalues_laplacian
      :type: lab.Numeric


      Eigenvalues of the Laplacian.



   .. py:property:: space
      :type: geometric_kernels.spaces.DiscreteSpectrumSpace


      The space on which the kernel is defined.



.. py:class:: MaternKernelHammingGraph(space, num_levels, normalize = True, eigenvalues_laplacian = None, eigenfunctions = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.kernels.karhunen_loeve.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel`


   For $\nu = \infty$, there exists a closed-form formula for the heat kernel
   on hamming graphs :class:`HammingGraph` (including the binary hypercube case
   :class:`HypercubeGraph`). This class extends :class:`MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel`
   to implement this formula in the case of $\nu = \infty$ for efficiency.

   .. note::
       We only use the closed form expression if `num_levels` is `d + 1` which
       corresponds to exact computation. When truncated to fewer levels, we
       must use the parent class implementation to ensure consistency with
       feature map approximations.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2 = None, **kwargs)

      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.

      :param params:
          A dict of kernel parameters, typically containing two keys:
          `"lengthscale"` for length scale and `"nu"` for smoothness.

          The types of values in the params dict determine the output type
          and the backend used for the internal computations, see the
          warning below for more details.

          .. note::
              The values `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]` are
              typically (1,)-shaped arrays of the suitable backend. This
              serves to point at the backend to be used for internal
              computations.

              In some cases, for example, when the kernel is
              :class:`~.kernels.ProductGeometricKernel`, the values of
              `params` may be (s,)-shaped arrays instead, where `s` is the
              number of factors.

          .. note::
              Finite values of `params["nu"]` typically correspond to the
              generalized (geometric) Matérn kernels.

              Infinite `params["nu"]` typically corresponds to the heat
              kernel (a.k.a. diffusion kernel, generalized squared
              exponential kernel, generalized Gaussian kernel,
              generalized RBF kernel). Although it is often considered to be
              a separate entity, we treat the heat kernel as a member of
              the Matérn family, with smoothness parameter equal to infinity.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.
      :param X2:
          A batch of M inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

          `X2=None` sets `X2=X1`.

          Defaults to None.

      :return:
          The N x M cross-covariance matrix.

      .. warning::
         The types of values in the `params` dict determine the backend
         used for internal computations and the output type.

         Even if, say, `geometric_kernels.jax` is imported but the values in
         the `params` dict are NumPy arrays, the output type will be a NumPy
         array, and NumPy will be used for internal computations. To get a
         JAX array as an output and use JAX for internal computations, all
         the values in the `params` dict must be JAX arrays.



   .. py:method:: K_diag(params, X, **kwargs)

      Returns the diagonal of the covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`,
      typically in a more efficient way than actually computing the full
      covariance matrix with `self.K(params, X, X)` and then extracting its
      diagonal.

      :param params:
          Same as for :meth:`~.K`.

      :param X:
          A batch of N inputs, each of which is a vector or a matrix,
          depending on how the elements of the `self.space` are represented.

      :return:
          The N-dimensional vector representing the diagonal of the
          covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`.



.. py:class:: ProductGeometricKernel(*kernels, dimension_indices = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.kernels.base.BaseGeometricKernel`


   Product kernel, defined as the product of a sequence of kernels.

   See :doc:`this page </theory/product_kernels>` for a brief account on
   theory behind product kernels and the :doc:`Torus.ipynb </examples/Torus>`
   notebook for a tutorial on how to use them.

   :param ``*kernels``:
       A sequence of kernels to compute the product of. Cannot contain another
       instance of :class:`ProductGeometricKernel`. We denote the number of
       factors, i.e. the length of the "sequence", by s.
   :param dimension_indices:
       Determines how a product kernel input vector `x` is to be mapped into
       the inputs `xi` for the factor kernels. `xi` are assumed to be equal to
       `x[dimension_indices[i]]`, possibly up to a reshape. Such a reshape
       might be necessary to accommodate the spaces whose elements are matrices
       rather than vectors, as determined by `element_shapes`. The
       transformation of `x` into the list of `xi`\ s is performed
       by :func:`~.project_product`.

       If None, assumes the each input is layed-out flattened and concatenated,
       in the same order as the factor spaces. In this case, the inverse to
       :func:`~.project_product` is :func:`~.make_product`.

       Defaults to None.

   .. note::
       `params` of a :class:`ProductGeometricKernel` are such that
       `params["lengthscale"]` and `params["nu"]` are (s,)-shaped arrays, where
       `s` is the number of factors.

       Basically, `params["lengthscale"][i]` stores the length scale parameter
       for the `i`-th factor kernel. Same goes for `params["nu"]`. Importantly,
       this enables *automatic relevance determination*-like behavior.


   .. py:method:: K(params, X, X2=None, **kwargs)

      Compute the cross-covariance matrix between two batches of vectors of
      inputs, or batches of matrices of inputs, depending on the space.

      :return:
          The N-dimensional vector representing the diagonal of the
          covariance matrix `self.K(params, X, X)`.



   .. py:method:: init_params()

      Returns a dict `params` where `params["lengthscale"]` is the
      concatenation of all `self.kernels[i].init_params()["lengthscale"]` and
      same for `params["nu"]`.



   .. py:property:: space
      :type: beartype.typing.List[geometric_kernels.spaces.Space]


      The list of spaces upon which the factor kernels are defined.



.. py:function:: default_feature_map(*, space = None, num = None, kernel = None)

   Constructs the default feature map for the specified space or kernel.

   :param space:
       A space to construct the feature map on. If provided, kernel must
       either be omitted or set to None.
   :param kernel:
       A kernel to construct the feature map from. If provided, `space` and
       `num` must either be omitted or set to None.
   :param num:
       Controls the number of features (dimensionality of the feature
       map). If omitted or set to None, the default value for each
       respective space is used. Must only be provided when
       constructing a feature map on a space (not from a kernel).

   :return:
       Callable which is the respective feature map.
