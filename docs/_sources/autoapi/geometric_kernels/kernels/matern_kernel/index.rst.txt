geometric_kernels.kernels.matern_kernel
=======================================

.. py:module:: geometric_kernels.kernels.matern_kernel

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides :class:`MaternGeometricKernel`,the geometric Matérn kernel---with
   the heat kernel as a special case---that just works.

   It wraps around different kernels and feature maps, dispatching on the space.

   Unless you know exactly what you are doing, use :class:`MaternGeometricKernel`.

.. py:class:: MaternGeometricKernel

   This class represents a Matérn geometric kernel that "just works". Unless
   you really know what you are doing, you should always use this kernel class.

   Upon creation, unpacks into a specific geometric kernel based on the
   provided space, and, optionally, the associated (approximate) feature map.


   .. py:method:: __new__(space, num = None, normalize = True, return_feature_map = False, **kwargs)

      Construct a kernel and (if `return_feature_map` is `True`) a
      feature map on `space`.

      .. note::
         See :doc:`this page </theory/feature_maps>` for a brief
         introduction into feature maps.

      :param space:
          Space to construct the kernel on.

      :param num:
          If provided, controls the "order of approximation" of the kernel.
          For the discrete spectrum spaces, this means the number of "levels"
          that go into the truncated series that defines the kernel (for
          example, these are unique eigenvalues for the
          :class:`~.spaces.Hypersphere` or eigenvalues with repetitions for
          the :class:`~.spaces.Graph` or for the :class:`~.spaces.Mesh`).
          For the non-compact symmetric spaces
          (:class:`~.spaces.NoncompactSymmetricSpace`), this is the number
          of random phases used to construct the kernel.

          If num=None, we use a (hopefully) reasonable default, which is
          space-dependent.

      :param normalize:
          Normalize the kernel (and the feature map). If normalize=True,
          then either $k(x, x) = 1$ for all $x \in X$, where $X$ is the
          `space`, or $\int_X k(x, x) d x = 1$, depending on the space.

          Defaults to True.

          .. note::
              For many kernel methods, $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ and
              $a k(\cdot, \cdot)$ are indistinguishable, whatever the
              positive constant $a$ is. For these, it makes sense to use
              normalize=False to save up some computational overhead. For
              others, like for the Gaussian process regression, the
              normalization of the kernel might be important. In
              these cases, you will typically want to set normalize=True.

      :param return_feature_map:
          If `True`, return a feature map (needed e.g. for efficient sampling
          from Gaussian processes) along with the kernel.

          Default is False.

      :param ``**kwargs``:
          Any additional keyword arguments to be passed to the kernel
          (like `key`).

      .. note::
         For non-compact symmetric spaces, like :class:`~.spaces.Hyperbolic`
         or :class:`~.spaces.SymmetricPositiveDefiniteMatrices`, the `key`
         **must** be provided in ``**kwargs``.



.. py:function:: default_feature_map(*, space = None, num = None, kernel = None)

   Constructs the default feature map for the specified space or kernel.

   :param space:
       A space to construct the feature map on. If provided, kernel must
       either be omitted or set to None.
   :param kernel:
       A kernel to construct the feature map from. If provided, `space` and
       `num` must either be omitted or set to None.
   :param num:
       Controls the number of features (dimensionality of the feature
       map). If omitted or set to None, the default value for each
       respective space is used. Must only be provided when
       constructing a feature map on a space (not from a kernel).

   :return:
       Callable which is the respective feature map.


.. py:function:: default_num(space: geometric_kernels.spaces.DiscreteSpectrumSpace) -> int
                 default_num(space: geometric_kernels.spaces.NoncompactSymmetricSpace) -> int

   Return the default approximation level for the `space`.

   :param space:
       A space.

   :return:
       The default approximation level.

   .. note::
      This function is organized as an abstract dispatcher plus a set of
      @overload-decorated implementations, one for each type of spaces.

      When followed by an "empty" @dispatch-decorated function of the same
      name, plum-dispatch changes the default behavior of the `@overload`
      decorator, allowing the implementations inside the preceding
      @overload-decorated functions. This is opposed to the standard behavior
      when @overload-decorated functions can only provide type signature,
      while the general implementation should be contained in the function
      of the same name without an `@overload` decorator.

      The trick is taken from https://beartype.github.io/plum/integration.html.

   .. note::
      For dispatching to work, the empty @dispatch-decorated function should
      follow (not precede) the @overload-decorated implementations in the code.

                 feature_map_from_kernel(kernel: geometric_kernels.kernels.feature_map.MaternFeatureMapKernel)

   Return the default feature map for the specified kernel `kernel`.

   :param kernel:
       A kernel to construct the feature map from.

   :return:
       A feature map.
   :rtype: feature_maps.FeatureMap

                 feature_map_from_space(space: geometric_kernels.spaces.NoncompactSymmetricSpace, num: int)

   Return the default feature map for the specified space `space` and
   approximation level `num`.

   :param space:
       A space to construct the feature map on.
   :param num:
       Approximation level.
