.. py:class:: Circle

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`


   The GeometricKernels space representing the standard unit circle, denoted
   by $\mathbb{S}_1$ (as the one-dimensional hypersphere) or $\mathbb{T}$ (as
   the one-dimensional torus).

   The elements of this space are represented by angles,
   scalars from $0$ to $2 \pi$.

   Levels are the whole eigenspaces. The zeroth eigenspace is
   one-dimensional, all the other eigenspaces are of dimension 2.

   .. note::
       The :doc:`example notebook on the torus </examples/Torus>` involves
       this space.

.. py:class:: CompactMatrixLieGroup

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`


   A base class for compact Lie groups of matrices, subgroups of the
   real or complex general linear group GL(n), n being some integer.

   The group operation is the standard matrix multiplication, and the group
   inverse is the standard matrix inverse. Despite this, we make the
   subclasses implement their own inverse routine, because in special cases
   it can typically be implemented much more efficiently. For example, for
   the special orthogonal group :class:`~.spaces.SpecialOrthogonal`, the
   inverse is equivalent to a simple transposition.


   .. py:method:: inverse(X)

      :abstractmethod:

          Each element is a n x n matrix.

      :return:
          A batch [..., n, n] with each n x n matrix inverted.



.. py:class:: DiscreteSpectrumSpace

   Bases: :py:obj:`Space`


   A Space with discrete spectrum (of the Laplacian operator).

   This includes, for instance, compact Riemannian manifolds, graphs & meshes.

   Subclasses implement routines for computing the eigenvalues and
   eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator, or certain combinations thereof.
   Since there is often an infinite or a prohibitively large number of those,
   they only compute a finite subset, consisting of the ones that are most
   important for approximating Matérn kernel best.

   .. note::
       See a brief introduction into the theory behind the geometric
       kernels on discrete spectrum spaces on the documentation pages devoted
       to :doc:`compact Riemannian manifolds </theory/compact>` (also

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`


   The GeometricKernels space representing the node set of any user-provided
   weighted undirected graph.

   The elements of this space are represented by node indices, integer values
   from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of nodes in the user-provided graph.

   Each individual eigenfunction constitutes a *level*.

   .. note::
       A tutorial on how to use this space is available in the

      .. note::
          If the `adjacency_matrix` was a sparse SciPy array, requesting
          **all** eigenpairs will lead to a conversion of the sparse matrix
          to a dense one due to scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh limitations.

      :param num:
          Number of eigenpairs to return. Performs the computation at the

.. py:class:: GraphEdges(num_nodes, oriented_edges, oriented_triangles, *, checks_mode = 'simple', index = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.HodgeDiscreteSpectrumSpace`


   The GeometricKernels space representing the edge set of a user-provided
   graph. The graph must be unweighted, undirected, and without loops.
   However, we assume the graph is oriented: for every edge, either (i, j)
   or (j, i) is chosen as the positively oriented edge, with the other one
   being negatively oriented. Any function f on this space must satisfy
   f(e) = -f(-e) if e is a positively oriented edge and -e is the
   corresponding negatively oriented edge.

   All positively oriented edges are indexed **from 1 to the number of edges
   (inclusive)**. The reason why we start indexing the edges from 1 is to
   allow for edge -e to correspond to the opposite orientation of edge e.
   Importantly, orientation or a particular ordering of edges does not
   affect the geometry of the space. However, changing those requires the
   respective change in the way you represent the data.

   For this space, each individual eigenfunction constitutes a *level*. If
   possible, we recommend using num=num_edges levels. Since the current
   implementation does not support sparse eigensolvers anyway, this should
   not create too much time/memory overhead during the precomputations and
   will also ensure that all types of eigenfunctions are present in the
   eigensystem.

   .. admonition:: Tutorial

       A tutorial on how to use this space is available in the
       :doc:`GraphEdges.ipynb </examples/GraphEdges>` notebook.

   .. admonition:: Theory

       Mathematically, this space is actually a simplicial 2-complex, and
       the functions satisfying the condition f(e) = -f(-e) are called
       1-cochains. These admit a Hodge decomposition into the harmonic,
       gradient, and curl parts. You can find more about Hodge decomposition
       on :doc:`this page </theory/graphs>`.

   .. admonition:: Construction

       **Easy way:** construct the space from the adjacency matrix of the graph.

       The easiest way to construct an instance of this space is to use the
       :meth:`from_adjacency` method, which constructs the space from the
       adjacency matrix of the graph. By default, this would use all possible
       triangles in the graph, but the user can also provide a list of
       triangles explicitly. These triangles define the curl operator on the
       graph and are thus instrumental in defining the Hodge decomposition.
       If you don't know what triangles to provide, you can leave this
       parameter empty, and the space will compute the maximal set of
       triangles for you, which is a good solution in most cases.

       When constructing an instance this way, the orientation of the edges and
       triangles is chosen automatically in such a way that (i, j) is always
       positively oriented if i < j, and the triangles are of form (e1, e2, e3)
       where e1 = (i, j), e2 = (j, k), e3 = -(i, k), and i < j < k.

       **Hard way:** construct the space from the oriented edges and triangles.

       When constructing an instance of this space directly via :meth:`__init__`,
       the user provides an `oriented_edges` array, mapping edge indices to
       ordered pairs of node indices, with order defining the positive
       orientation, and an `oriented_triangles` array, mapping triangle indices
       to triples of signed edge indices. These arrays must be compatible in
       the sense that the edges in triangles must be connected. This way, the
       user has full control over the orientation and ordering of the edges.

   .. admonition:: Complexity

       The current implementation of the GraphEdges space is supposed to occupy
       O(num_edges^2) memory and take O(num_edges^3) time to compute the eigensystem.

       Currently, it does not support sparse eigensolvers, which would allow
       storing the Laplacian matrices in a sparse format and potentially reduce
       the O(num_edges^3) complexity to O(num_edges) with a large constant.

   :param num_nodes:
       The number of nodes in the graph.

   :param oriented_edges:
       A 2D array of shape [num_edges, 2], where num_edges is the number of edges
       in the graph. Each row of the array represents an oriented edge, i.e.,
       a pair of node indices. If `oriented_edges[e]` is `[i, j]`, then the
       edge with index e+1 (edge indexing starts from 1) represents an edge
       from node `i` to node `j` which is considered positively oriented, while
       the edge with index -e-1 represents an edge from node `j` to node `i`.

       Make sure that `oriented_edges` and `oriented_triangles` are of the
       backend (NumPy / JAX / TensorFlow, PyTorch) that you wish to use for
       internal computations.

   :param oriented_triangles:
       A 2D array of shape [num_triangles, 3], where num_triangles is the number
       of triangles in the graph. Each row of the array represents an
       oriented triangle, i.e., a triple of signed edge indices. If
       `oriented_triangles[t]` is `[i, j, k]`, then `t` consists of the edges
       `|i|`, `|j|`, and `|k|`, where the sign of the edge index indicates
       the orientation of the edge. Optional. If not provided or set to
       `None`, we assume that the set of triangles is empty.

       Make sure that `oriented_edges` and `oriented_triangles` are of the
       backend (NumPy / JAX / TensorFlow, PyTorch) that you wish to use for
       internal computations.

   :param checks_mode:
       A keyword argument that determines the level of checks performed on
       the oriented_edges and oriented_triangles arrays. The default value is
       "simple", which performs only basic checks. The other possible values
       are "comprehensive" and "skip", which perform more extensive checks
       and no checks, respectively. The "comprehensive" mode is useful for
       debugging but can be slow for large graphs.

   :param index:
       Optional. A sparse matrix of shape [num_nodes, num_nodes] such that
       `index[i, j]` is the index of the edge `(i, j)` in the `oriented_edges`.
       `index[i, j]` is positive if (i, j) corresponds to positive orientation
       of the edge, and negative if it corresponds to the negative orientation.
       If provided, should be compatible with the `oriented_edges` array.

       Since the degree matrix is a constant multiple of the identity, all
       types of the graph Laplacian coincide on the Hamming graph up to a
       constant, we choose the normalized Laplacian for numerical stability.

   The GeometricKernels space representing the n-dimensional hyperbolic space
   $\mathbb{H}_n$. We use the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic space.

   The elements of this space are represented by (n+1)-dimensional vectors
   satisfying

   .. math:: x_0^2 - x_1^2 - \ldots - x_n^2 = 1,

   i.e. lying on the hyperboloid.

   The class inherits the interface of geomstats's `Hyperbolic` with

   .. note::
       As mentioned in :ref:`this note <quotient note>`, any symmetric space
       is a quotient G/H. For the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}_n$, the group
       of symmetries $G$ is the proper Lorentz group $SO(1, n)$,  while the
       isotropy subgroup $H$ is the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$. See the

   .. py:method:: inv_harish_chandra(lam)

      Implements $c^{-1}(\lambda)$, where $c$ is the Harish-Chandra's $c$
      function.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of frequencies, vectors of dimension equal to the rank of
          symmetric space.

      :return:
          $c^{-1}(\lambda)$ evaluated at every $\lambda$ in the batch `lam`.



   .. py:method:: power_function(lam, g, h)

      Implements the *power function* $p^{\lambda}(g, h)$, the integrand
      appearing in the definition of the zonal spherical function

      .. math:: \pi^{\lambda}(g) = \int_{H} \underbrace{p^{\lambda}(g, h)}_{= e^{(i \lambda + \rho) a(h \cdot g)}} d h,

      where $\lambda \in i \cdot \mathbb{R}^r$, with $r$ denoting the rank of
      the symmetric space and $i$ the imaginary unit, is a sort of frequency,
      $g$ is an element of the group of symmetries $G$, $h$ is an element
      of its isotropy subgroup $H$ ($G$ and $H$ are defined :ref:`here
      <quotient note>`), $\rho \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is as in :meth:`rho`, and
      the function $a$ is a certain space-dependent algebraic operation.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of L vectors of dimension `rank`, the rank of the
          symmetric space, representing the "sort of frequencies".

          Typically of shape [1, L, rank].
      :param g:
          A batch of N elements of the space (these can always be thought of
          as elements of the group of symmetries $G$ since the symmetric
          space $G/H$ can be trivially embedded into the group $G$).

          Typically of shape [N, 1, <axes>], where <axes> is the shape of
          the elements of the space.
      :param h:
          A batch of L elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

          Typically of shape [1, L, <axes_p>], where <axes_p> is the shape of
          arrays representing the elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

      :return:
          An array of shape [N, L] with complex number entries, representing
          the value of the values of $p^{\lambda_l}(g_n, h_l)$ for all
          $1 \leq n \leq N$ and $1 \leq l \leq L$.

      .. note::
          Actually, $a$ may be a more appropriate primitive than the power
          function $p^{\lambda}$: everything but $a$ in the definition of
          the latter is either standard or available as other primitives.
          Us using $p^{\lambda}$ as a primitive is quite arbitrary.



   .. py:method:: random(key, number)

   .. py:method:: random_phases(key, num)

      Sample uniformly random points on the isotropy subgroup $H$ (defined
      :ref:`here <quotient note>`).

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).

          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `num` uniformly random samples in the isotropy
          subgroup $H$.

      .. warning::
          This does not sample random points on the space itself. Since the
          space itself is non-compact, uniform sampling on it is in principle
          impossible. However, the isotropy subgroup $H$ is always
          compact and thus allows uniform sampling needed to approximate the
          zonal spherical functions $\pi^{\lambda}(\cdot)$ via Monte Carlo.

   The GeometricKernels space representing the d-dimensional hypercube graph
   $C^d = \{0, 1\}^d$, the combinatorial space of binary vectors of length $d$.

      .. note::
          If the `adjacency_matrix` was a sparse SciPy array, requesting
          **all** eigenpairs will lead to a conversion of the sparse matrix
          to a dense one due to scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh limitations.

.. py:class:: NoncompactSymmetricSpace

   Bases: :py:obj:`Space`


   Non-compact symmetric space.

   This includes, for instance, hyperbolic spaces and manifolds of symmetric
   positive definite matrices (endowed with the affine-invariant metric).

   .. note::
       See a brief introduction into the theory behind the geometric
       kernels on non-compact symmetric spaces on the
       :doc:`respective documentation page </theory/symmetric>`.

   .. note::
       Typically used with :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` that
       builds on a space-specific feature map like the
       :class:`~.feature_maps.RejectionSamplingFeatureMapHyperbolic` and the
       :class:`~.feature_maps.RejectionSamplingFeatureMapSPD`, or, in the
       absence of a space-specific feature map, on the general (typically less
       effective) map :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`.

   .. note:: .. _quotient note:

       Mathematically, any non-compact symmetric space can be represented as
       a quotient $G/H$ of a Lie group of symmetries $G$ and its compact
       isotropy subgroup $H$. We sometimes refer to these $G$ and $H$ in
       the documentation. See mathematical details in :cite:t:`azangulov2024b`.


   .. py:method:: dimension()
      :abstractmethod:


      Geometric dimension of the space.

      Examples:

      * :class:`~.spaces.Hyperbolic`: d-dimensional, with d >= 2.
      * :class:`~.spaces.SymmetricPositiveDefiniteMatrices`: $n(n+1)/2$-dimensional,
          with n >= 2.



   .. py:method:: inv_harish_chandra(lam)
      :abstractmethod:


      Implements $c^{-1}(\lambda)$, where $c$ is the Harish-Chandra's $c$
      function.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of frequencies, vectors of dimension equal to the rank of
          symmetric space.

      :return:
          $c^{-1}(\lambda)$ evaluated at every $\lambda$ in the batch `lam`.



   .. py:method:: num_axes()
      :abstractmethod:


      Number of axes in an array representing a point in the space.

      Usually 1 for vectors or 2 for matrices.



   .. py:method:: power_function(lam, g, h)
      :abstractmethod:


      Implements the *power function* $p^{\lambda}(g, h)$, the integrand
      appearing in the definition of the zonal spherical function

      .. math:: \pi^{\lambda}(g) = \int_{H} \underbrace{p^{\lambda}(g, h)}_{= e^{(i \lambda + \rho) a(h \cdot g)}} d h,

      where $\lambda \in i \cdot \mathbb{R}^r$, with $r$ denoting the rank of
      the symmetric space and $i$ the imaginary unit, is a sort of frequency,
      $g$ is an element of the group of symmetries $G$, $h$ is an element
      of its isotropy subgroup $H$ ($G$ and $H$ are defined :ref:`here
      <quotient note>`), $\rho \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is as in :meth:`rho`, and
      the function $a$ is a certain space-dependent algebraic operation.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of L vectors of dimension `rank`, the rank of the
          symmetric space, representing the "sort of frequencies".

          Typically of shape [1, L, rank].
      :param g:
          A batch of N elements of the space (these can always be thought of
          as elements of the group of symmetries $G$ since the symmetric
          space $G/H$ can be trivially embedded into the group $G$).

          Typically of shape [N, 1, <axes>], where <axes> is the shape of
          the elements of the space.
      :param h:
          A batch of L elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

          Typically of shape [1, L, <axes_p>], where <axes_p> is the shape of
          arrays representing the elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

      :return:
          An array of shape [N, L] with complex number entries, representing
          the value of the values of $p^{\lambda_l}(g_n, h_l)$ for all
          $1 \leq n \leq N$ and $1 \leq l \leq L$.

      .. note::
          Actually, $a$ may be a more appropriate primitive than the power
          function $p^{\lambda}$: everything but $a$ in the definition of
          the latter is either standard or available as other primitives.
          Us using $p^{\lambda}$ as a primitive is quite arbitrary.



   .. py:method:: random_phases(key, num)
      :abstractmethod:


      Sample uniformly random points on the isotropy subgroup $H$ (defined
      :ref:`here <quotient note>`).

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).
      :param num:
          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `num` uniformly random samples in the isotropy
          subgroup $H$.

      .. warning::
          This does not sample random points on the space itself. Since the
          space itself is non-compact, uniform sampling on it is in principle
          impossible. However, the isotropy subgroup $H$ is always
          compact and thus allows uniform sampling needed to approximate the
          zonal spherical functions $\pi^{\lambda}(\cdot)$ via Monte Carlo.



   .. py:method:: rho()
      :abstractmethod:


      `rho` vector of dimension equal to the rank of the symmetric space.

      Algebraically, weighted sum of *roots*, depends only on the space.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.



.. py:class:: ProductDiscreteSpectrumSpace(*spaces, num_levels = 25, num_levels_per_space = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`


   The GeometricKernels space representing a product

   .. math:: \mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_1 \times \ldots \mathcal{S}_S

   of :class:`~.spaces.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`-s $\mathcal{S}_i$.

   Levels are indexed by tuples of levels of the factors.

   .. admonition:: Precomputing optimal levels

       The eigenvalue corresponding to a level of the product space
       represented by a tuple $(j_1, .., j_S)$ is the sum

       .. math:: \lambda^{(1)}_{j_1} + \ldots + \lambda^{(S)}_{j_S}

       of the eigenvalues $\lambda^{(s)}_{j_s}$ of the factors.

       Computing top `num_levels` smallest eigenvalues is thus a combinatorial
       problem, the solution to which we precompute. To make this
       precomputation possible you need to provide the `num_levels` parameter
       when constructing the :class:`ProductDiscreteSpectrumSpace`, unlike for
       other spaces. What is more, the `num` parameter of the
       :meth:`get_eigenfunctions` cannot be larger than the `num_levels` value.

   .. note::
       See :doc:`this page </theory/product_spaces>` for a brief account on
       theory behind product spaces and the :doc:`Torus.ipynb
       </examples/Torus>` notebook for a tutorial on how to use them.

       An alternative to using :class:`ProductDiscreteSpectrumSpace` is to use
       the :class:`~.kernels.ProductGeometricKernel` kernel. The latter is more
       flexible, allowing more general spaces as factors and automatic
       relevance determination -like behavior.

   :param spaces:
       The factors, subclasses of :class:`~.spaces.DiscreteSpectrumSpace`.
   :param num_levels:
       The number of levels to pre-compute for this product space.
   :param num_levels_per_space:
       Number of levels to fetch for each of the factor spaces, to compute
       the product-space levels. This is a single number rather than a list,
       because we currently only support fetching the same number of levels
       for all the factor spaces.

       If not given, `num_levels` levels will be fetched for each factor.

   The elements of this space are represented by positive definite matrices of

   .. py:method:: inv_harish_chandra(lam)

      Implements $c^{-1}(\lambda)$, where $c$ is the Harish-Chandra's $c$
      function.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of frequencies, vectors of dimension equal to the rank of
          symmetric space.

      :return:
          $c^{-1}(\lambda)$ evaluated at every $\lambda$ in the batch `lam`.



   .. py:method:: power_function(lam, g, h)

      Implements the *power function* $p^{\lambda}(g, h)$, the integrand
      appearing in the definition of the zonal spherical function

      .. math:: \pi^{\lambda}(g) = \int_{H} \underbrace{p^{\lambda}(g, h)}_{= e^{(i \lambda + \rho) a(h \cdot g)}} d h,

      where $\lambda \in i \cdot \mathbb{R}^r$, with $r$ denoting the rank of
      the symmetric space and $i$ the imaginary unit, is a sort of frequency,
      $g$ is an element of the group of symmetries $G$, $h$ is an element
      of its isotropy subgroup $H$ ($G$ and $H$ are defined :ref:`here
      <quotient note>`), $\rho \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is as in :meth:`rho`, and
      the function $a$ is a certain space-dependent algebraic operation.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of L vectors of dimension `rank`, the rank of the
          symmetric space, representing the "sort of frequencies".

          Typically of shape [1, L, rank].
      :param g:
          A batch of N elements of the space (these can always be thought of
          as elements of the group of symmetries $G$ since the symmetric
          space $G/H$ can be trivially embedded into the group $G$).

          Typically of shape [N, 1, <axes>], where <axes> is the shape of
          the elements of the space.
      :param h:
          A batch of L elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

          Typically of shape [1, L, <axes_p>], where <axes_p> is the shape of
          arrays representing the elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

      :return:
          An array of shape [N, L] with complex number entries, representing
          the value of the values of $p^{\lambda_l}(g_n, h_l)$ for all
          $1 \leq n \leq N$ and $1 \leq l \leq L$.

      .. note::
          Actually, $a$ may be a more appropriate primitive than the power
          function $p^{\lambda}$: everything but $a$ in the definition of
          the latter is either standard or available as other primitives.
          Us using $p^{\lambda}$ as a primitive is quite arbitrary.



   .. py:method:: random(key, number)

      Non-uniform random sampling, reimplements the algorithm from geomstats.

      Always returns [N, n, n] float64 array of the `key`'s backend.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).
      :param number:
          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `number` random samples on the space.



   .. py:method:: random_phases(key, num)

      Sample uniformly random points on the isotropy subgroup $H$ (defined
      :ref:`here <quotient note>`).

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).
      :param num:
          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `num` uniformly random samples in the isotropy
          subgroup $H$.

      .. warning::
          This does not sample random points on the space itself. Since the
          space itself is non-compact, uniform sampling on it is in principle
          impossible. However, the isotropy subgroup $H$ is always
          compact and thus allows uniform sampling needed to approximate the
          zonal spherical functions $\pi^{\lambda}(\cdot)$ via Monte Carlo.



   .. py:property:: dimension
      :type: int


      Returns n(n+1)/2 where `n` was passed down to `__init__`.



   .. py:property:: element_dtype

      :return:
          B.Float.



   .. py:property:: element_shape

      :return:
          [n, n].



   .. py:property:: num_axes

      Number of axes in an array representing a point in the space.

      :return:
          2.



   .. py:property:: rho

      `rho` vector of dimension equal to the rank of the symmetric space.

      Algebraically, weighted sum of *roots*, depends only on the space.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.
