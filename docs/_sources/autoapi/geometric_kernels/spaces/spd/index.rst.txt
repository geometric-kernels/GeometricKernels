.. py:class:: SymmetricPositiveDefiniteMatrices(n)

   Bases: :py:obj:`geometric_kernels.spaces.base.NoncompactSymmetricSpace`, :py:obj:`geomstats.geometry.spd_matrices.SPDMatrices`


   The GeometricKernels space representing the manifold of symmetric positive
   definite matrices $SPD(n)$ with the affine-invariant Riemannian metric.

   The elements of this space are represented by positive definite matrices of
   size n x n. Positive definite means _strictly_ positive definite here, not
   positive semi-definite.

   The class inherits the interface of geomstats's `SPDMatrices`.

   .. note::
       A tutorial on how to use this space is available in the
       :doc:`SPD.ipynb </examples/SPD>` notebook.

   :param n:
       Size of the matrices, the $n$ in $SPD(n)$.

   .. note::
       As mentioned in :ref:`this note <quotient note>`, any symmetric space
       is a quotient G/H. For the manifold of symmetric positive definite
       matrices $SPD(n)$, the group of symmetries $G$ is the identity component
       $GL(n)_+$ of the general linear group $GL(n)$, while the isotropy
       subgroup $H$ is the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$. See the
       mathematical details in :cite:t:`azangulov2024b`.

   .. admonition:: Citation

       If you use this GeometricKernels space in your research, please consider

   .. py:method:: inv_harish_chandra(lam)

      Implements $c^{-1}(\lambda)$, where $c$ is the Harish-Chandra's $c$
      function.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of frequencies, vectors of dimension equal to the rank of
          symmetric space.

      :return:
          $c^{-1}(\lambda)$ evaluated at every $\lambda$ in the batch `lam`.



   .. py:method:: power_function(lam, g, h)

      Implements the *power function* $p^{\lambda}(g, h)$, the integrand
      appearing in the definition of the zonal spherical function

      .. math:: \pi^{\lambda}(g) = \int_{H} \underbrace{p^{\lambda}(g, h)}_{= e^{(i \lambda + \rho) a(h \cdot g)}} d h,

      where $\lambda \in i \cdot \mathbb{R}^r$, with $r$ denoting the rank of
      the symmetric space and $i$ the imaginary unit, is a sort of frequency,
      $g$ is an element of the group of symmetries $G$, $h$ is an element
      of its isotropy subgroup $H$ ($G$ and $H$ are defined :ref:`here
      <quotient note>`), $\rho \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is as in :meth:`rho`, and
      the function $a$ is a certain space-dependent algebraic operation.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param lam:
          A batch of L vectors of dimension `rank`, the rank of the
          symmetric space, representing the "sort of frequencies".

          Typically of shape [1, L, rank].
      :param g:
          A batch of N elements of the space (these can always be thought of
          as elements of the group of symmetries $G$ since the symmetric
          space $G/H$ can be trivially embedded into the group $G$).

          Typically of shape [N, 1, <axes>], where <axes> is the shape of
          the elements of the space.
      :param h:
          A batch of L elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

          Typically of shape [1, L, <axes_p>], where <axes_p> is the shape of
          arrays representing the elements of the isotropy subgroup $H$.

      :return:
          An array of shape [N, L] with complex number entries, representing
          the value of the values of $p^{\lambda_l}(g_n, h_l)$ for all
          $1 \leq n \leq N$ and $1 \leq l \leq L$.

      .. note::
          Actually, $a$ may be a more appropriate primitive than the power
          function $p^{\lambda}$: everything but $a$ in the definition of
          the latter is either standard or available as other primitives.
          Us using $p^{\lambda}$ as a primitive is quite arbitrary.



   .. py:method:: random(key, number)

      Non-uniform random sampling, reimplements the algorithm from geomstats.

      Always returns [N, n, n] float64 array of the `key`'s backend.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).
      :param number:
          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `number` random samples on the space.



   .. py:method:: random_phases(key, num)

      Sample uniformly random points on the isotropy subgroup $H$ (defined
      :ref:`here <quotient note>`).

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.

      :param key:
          Either `np.random.RandomState`, `tf.random.Generator`,
          `torch.Generator` or `jax.tensor` (representing random state).
      :param num:
          Number of samples to draw.

      :return:
          An array of `num` uniformly random samples in the isotropy
          subgroup $H$.

      .. warning::
          This does not sample random points on the space itself. Since the
          space itself is non-compact, uniform sampling on it is in principle
          impossible. However, the isotropy subgroup $H$ is always
          compact and thus allows uniform sampling needed to approximate the
          zonal spherical functions $\pi^{\lambda}(\cdot)$ via Monte Carlo.



   .. py:property:: dimension
      :type: int


      Returns n(n+1)/2 where `n` was passed down to `__init__`.



   .. py:property:: element_dtype

      :return:
          B.Float.



   .. py:property:: element_shape

      :return:
          [n, n].



   .. py:property:: num_axes

      Number of axes in an array representing a point in the space.

      :return:
          2.



   .. py:property:: rho

      `rho` vector of dimension equal to the rank of the symmetric space.

      Algebraically, weighted sum of *roots*, depends only on the space.

      This is one of the computational primitives required to (approximately)
      compute the :class:`~.feature_maps.RandomPhaseFeatureMapNoncompact`
      feature map and :class:`~.kernels.MaternFeatureMapKernel` on top of it.
