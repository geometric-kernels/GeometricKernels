This module provides base classes for storing or evaluating eigenfunctions of
the Laplacian, or certain combinations thereof (see the note below).

.. note::
    Sometimes, when relations analogous to the :doc:`addition theorem
    </theory/addition_theorem>` on the sphere are available, it is much more
    efficient to use certain sums of outer products of eigenfunctions instead
    of the eigenfunctions themselves. For this, we offer
    :class:`EigenfunctionsWithAdditionTheorem`. Importantly, it is permitted to
    _only_ provide the computational routines for these "certain sums", lacking
    the actual capability to compute the eigenfunctions themselves. This is
    important because for compact Lie groups, for example, computing
    eigenfunctions is more involved and less efficient than computing the
    "certain sums", called characters in this case. This is also relevant for
    hyperspheres of higher dimension: in this case, the eigenfunctions
    (spherical harmonics) are much more cumbersome than the "certain
    sums" (zonal spherical harmonics).

class Eigenfunctions(abc.ABC):
    r"""
    Abstract base class providing an interface for working with eigenfunctions.

    We denote the basis of eigenfunctions represented by an instance of
    this class by $[f_j]_{j=0}^{J-1}$. We assume it to be partitioned into
    *levels* (see :class:`~.kernels.MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel` on how they are
    used). Specifically, we call the sets $[f_{l s}]_{s=1}^{d_l}$ *levels* if

    .. math:: [f_j]_{j=0}^{J-1} = \bigcup_{l=0}^{L-1}[f_{l s}]_{s=1}^{d_l}

    such that all the eigenfunctions $f_{l s}$ with the same index $l$
    correspond to the same eigenvalue $\lambda_l$. Note, however, that
    $\lambda_l$ are not required to be unique: it is possible that for some
    $l,l'$, $\lambda_l = \lambda_{l'}$.

    .. note::
        There is often more than one way to choose a partition into levels.
        Trivially, you can always correspond a level to each individual
        eigenfunction. Alternatively, you can partition $[f_j]_{j=0}^{J-1}$
        into the maximal subsets corresponding to the same eigenvalue (into
        the *full eigenspaces*). There are also often plenty of possibilities
        in between these two extremes.

    Importantly, subclasses of this class do not necessarily have to allow
    computing the individual eigenfunctions (i.e. implement the method
    :meth:`__call__`). The only methods that subclasses *have to* implement
    are :meth:`phi_product` and its close relative :meth:`phi_product_diag`.
    These output the sums of outer products of eigenfunctions for all levels:

    .. math:: \sum_{s=1}^{d_l} f_{l s}(x_1) f_{l s}(x_2)

    for all $0 \leq l < L$, and all pairs $x_1$, $x_2$ provided as inputs.
