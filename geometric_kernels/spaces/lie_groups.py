class WeylAdditionTheorem(EigenfunctionsWithAdditionTheorem):
    r"""
    A class for computing the sums of outer products of certain combinations
    (we call "levels") of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions on compact Lie
    groups. These are much like the *zonal spherical harmonics* of the
    :class:`~.SphericalHarmonics` class. However, the key to computing them
    is representation-theoretic: they are proportional to *characters* of
    irreducible unitary representations of the group. These characters, in their
    turn, can be algebraically computed using the *Weyl character formula*. See
    :cite:t:`azangulov2022` for the mathematical details behind this class.

    :param n:
        The order of the Lie group, e.g. for SO(5) this is 5, for SU(3) this is 3.
    :param num_levels:
        The number of levels used for kernel approximation. Here, each level
        corresponds to an irreducible unitary representation of the group.
    :param compute_characters:
        Whether or not to actually compute the *characters*. Setting this parameter
        to False might make sense if you do not care about eigenfunctions (or sums
        of outer products thereof), but care about eigenvalues, dimensions of
        irreducible unitary representations, etc.

        Defaults to True.

    .. note::
        Unlike :class:`~.SphericalHarmonics`, we do not expect the
        descendants of this class to compute the actual Laplace-Beltrami
        eigenfunctions (which are similar to (non-zonal) *spherical harmonics*
        of :class:`~.SphericalHarmonics`), implementing the `__call___` method.
        In this case, this is not really necessary and computationally harder.

    .. note::
        Unlike in :class:`~.SphericalHarmonics`, here the levels do not
        necessarily correspond to whole eigenspaces (all eigenfunctions that
        correspond to the same eigenvalue). Here, levels are defined in terms of
        the algebraic structure of the group: they are the eigenfunctions that
        correspond to the same irreducible unitary representation of the group.

    .. note::
        Here we break the general convention that the subclasses of the
        :class:`~.eigenfunctions.Eigenfunctions` only provide an interface for
        working with eigenfunctions, not eigenvalues, offering an interface
        for computing the latter as well.
